Advent of code 2017 completed in python
https://adventofcode.com/2017/

Advent of code is a yearly event in December, which takes place over 25 days and has 50 programming challenges. Each day contains two problems to solve: One easier, and one harder.
For the 2017 event, I will be tackling the entire 25 day gauntlet, using only core Py3 libaries (although numpy was a temptation several times)
